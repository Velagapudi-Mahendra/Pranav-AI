## âœ… Tasks Completed

1. **Project Setup**

   * Created GitHub repository: `pranav-Ai`.
   * Initialized project structure:

     ```
     pranav-Ai/
       â”œâ”€ src/
       â”œâ”€ notebooks/
       â”œâ”€ docs/
       â””â”€ data/
     ```

2. **Documentation Kickoff**

   * Added `README.md` with project vision, setup instructions, goals, and milestones.
   * Created `docs/` folder with:

     * `problem_statement.md`
     * `objectives.md`
     * `roadmap.md`

3. **Coding Kickoff**

   * Added `src/main.py` with simple "Hello from Pranav-AI ðŸš€".
   * Successfully ran the script locally.

4. **Project Environment**

   * Created `requirements.txt` with core Python dependencies.
   * Added `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary files (`__pycache__/`, `.vscode/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `venv/`, etc.).

5. **Stretch Goal**

   * Created `notebooks/experiments.ipynb` with first "Hello from Notebook" cell.
   * Ensured `.gitignore` ignores Jupyter checkpoints.
